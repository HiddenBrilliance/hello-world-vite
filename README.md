This project utilizes React + Vite to make a flight tracker that lists airline flights by flight number, dates and destinations.

I Utilize Mapping to make the data show up on the view by returning the mapped data in a table data html element in my App.

This version uses mock data but eventually I plan to add api data from real time flight trackers as well as the ability to search and filter in later versions.
